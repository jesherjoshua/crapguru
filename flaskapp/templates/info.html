        technologies to achieve our goals of creating awareness and educating the masses about responsible
        consumption
        and production, as well as climate action.

        One key aspect of our project is our use of <strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong> to power our app and API endpoint.
        We use <strong>Cloud Run</strong> to host our app, which allows us to easily deploy and scale our application to meet the needs
        of
        our users. Additionally, we use <strong>Cloud Functions</strong> to create an API endpoint, which enables us to interact with
        our
        app and data in a flexible and cost-effective manner.

        We also rely on <strong>Cloud Storage</strong> to store our machine learning models and data, which allows us to easily
        access
        and manipulate these resources as needed. And for storing our Docker images, we use the <strong>Container Registry</strong>,
        which enables us to manage and deploy our containerized applications with ease.

        In terms of software and frameworks, we use <strong>Python</strong> as our primary programming language, and <strong>TensorFlow </strong>as
        our
        machine learning library. We also utilize <strong>MobileNet</strong>, a pre-trained deep learning model, to classify and
        segregate different types of waste. Finally, we use <strong>Flask</strong> to build our app and API endpoint, which provides
        a
        lightweight and easy-to-use web framework.

        Altogether, these technologies and frameworks enable us to create a powerful and efficient platform for
        addressing two of the <strong>UN's Sustainable Development Goals</strong>.
